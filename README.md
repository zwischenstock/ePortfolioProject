Setting up the Wildlife Zoo web app:  
* Edit the `.env` file to configure the MongoDB information and session secret. To generate a random secret key, consider simply using `openssl rand -h 16`.  
* Run `npm install` to install the app dependencies.  

Setting up MongoDB:  
* Follow [this guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/) to configure a user account with access to the zoo database, providing the user account with access to read and write to the database.  
* Import the example file into MongoDB using mongoimport. Once up and running, execute the following: `mongoimport --port DB_PORT --type csv --headerline --db DB_DATABASE --collection animals -u DB_USER -p DB_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin example_animal_data.csv`. Replace the uppercase text with their respective values stored in `.env`.
